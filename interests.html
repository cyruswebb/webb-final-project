                    <h3>Outside of the Classroom</h3>

                    <p>Outside of the classroom I love to do anything outdoors. Whether it be hiking on the nearby Appalachian trail for a weekend, running around the Pandapas Pond trail system, or fishing around the town of Blacksburg, I love to be outside in the Appalachian Mountains around Blacksburg. Without a doubt my main passion is running. Whenever I have a spare moment I am usually running on one of the many great running trails around Blacksburg. Oh, and I am also a very lackluster member of the Virginia Tech Triathlon club. While I am fairly inconsistent in my involvement with the triathlon club at Virginia Tech, it is exactly this type of extracurricular commitment that the university is pushing for. They want individuals to participate in extracurricular activities that will help serve the community as well as broaden their horizons. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Inside the Classroom</h3>
                    
                    <p>My academic interests lie with reading and writing. I am fascinated by the ability of authors to capture emotions and brief moments in time, and it is my goal to cultivate my own ability to do so. Thus, devote the majority of my academic classes to studying various authors and forms of literature while also attempting to develop my own unique style of writing. However, I am also very fascinated with the human condition and take at least one class every semester in sociology. I feel that being able to better understand the social aspects of society and humanity will only aid me in my development as a writer. This is exactly what Virginia Tech is attempting to encourage with their general education program. Encouraging students to broaden their educational interests in order to further the advancement of their core program of study. </p>
