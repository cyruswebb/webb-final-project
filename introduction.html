                    <h3>Background</h3>

                    <p>My name is Cyrus Webb and I am a rising Senior at Virginia Tech majoring in Literature and Language. I spent my formative years in Charlottesville, VA, right next door to the other major state institution of higher learning, UVA. I am also a transfer student as I attended community college for a year and a half prior to enrolling at Virginia Tech as a Junior. Thus, I have a slightly more unique relationship to the VT community as well as the idea of the VT Shaped Student. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Experience</h3>
                    <p>I have very limited experience in digital writing, as this is the first college level digital writing class that I have ever taken. However, I was the editor of my high school yearbook, and the majority of the yearbook was edited online through a text editor. So, while I have limited experience at the collegiate level in regards to digital writing, I do have some knowledge and experience with text editors. </p>
                    
                    <h3>The VT Shaped Student: My Opinion</h3>
                    <p>While I will go into greater detail about the VT shaped student throughout this website, I first wanted to just let you know my biases in regards to the VT shaped student. I love the idea of the VT shaped student, and I believe that it is a powerful outline of how a student should be educated. Virginia Tech makes a strong effort to mold their students into community oriented communicators and problem solvers by providing them with a combination of “T-shaped” and “V-shaped” educational opportunities. However, I am of the opinion that Virginia Tech could do more to stress the idea of a global education. Virginia Tech lacks the diversity of backgrounds and educational opportunities that I experienced in community college, and I feel that is an area that the university needs to address when shaping their educational curriculum for the future. </p>
