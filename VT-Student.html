                    <h1>VT-Shaped Student Essay</h1>
                    <h3>Claim</h3>
                    <p>I am working on becoming a VT-shaped student but am currently not quite there. While I embrace the idea of the VT-shaped student and want to become a well-rounded VT-shaped student, I recognize that I have some work to do before I can classify myself as a VT-shaped student. </p>
                    <h3>The T-Shaped Student: Vertical Component</h3>

                    <p>As I stated on the previous page, the Vertical component of a T-shaped student deals with a student’s study of their major. My major of study is literature and language, which falls under the umbrella of the English department. All in all, I feel like this is the area of the VT-shaped student that I best embody, as I take all of the English classes necessary for my degree as well as several English electives, such as Intro to Science Fiction, that are not required but that I desire to take anyway. I am also very avid about my English studies and frequent the office hours of many of my English professors and even have them look over several of my freelance short stories to gauge their opinion. So, all in all, I feel that I embody the vertical component of a T-shaped student as I am very engaged in my English studies. </p>
                    
                    <h3>The T-Shaped Student: Horizontal Component</h3>
                    
                    <p>The horizontal component of a T-shaped student deals with a student’s general education as well as a student’s internship, research, and extra educational opportunities. This is an area of the VT-shaped student that I do not fully embody, and it is a weak area that I am working to improve upon. While I do a very good job of taking a wide variety of general education classes, which is reflected in my interest in sociology as well as communications, I do not do much research and I have yet to partake in any internships. I am thinking about doing some writing for the Silhouette school publication at Virginia Tech and am considering getting involved with the editing process for its semi-annual publication. Research is where things get tougher. I know that I need to reach out to more professors and see if they need any help with compiling their research, and it is something that I will consider doing this fall. All in all, I have work to do when it comes to developing the horizontal component of a T-shaped student, however, it is work I am willing to put in in order to become a more well-rounded VT-shaped student.  </p>
                    
                    <h3>The V-Shaped Student</h3>
                    
                    <p>The V of the VT-shaped student is a component that I am very strong in, and have developed through a plethora of community oriented experiences. For instance, I work at a running store in my free time and, while the job seems rather mundane, I am always surprise by the impact that I am able to have on the lives of those I assist merely by using the communication and listening skills that I have developed at Virginia Tech through the classes that I have taken. The most important skill in this world is to be a strong communicator and it is a skill that I have managed to develop throughout my time at Virginia Tech. Merely by letting someone know that I understand where they are coming from and really want to help them I am able to help them get back on a fitness journey or lose the weight they have been trying to shake. I often feel like I am serving the community, in a small manner, by helping those I work with get back in shape. I also have volunteered for Habitat for Humanity in the past and am hoping to volunteer with the organization more in the coming months. Once again I am able to take my skills as a communicator that I have developed at Virginia Tech and leave a serviceable impact on the community. I am thinking of becoming a teacher in the future as well, which, in my opinion, is one of the most service oriented careers in the world. So, I feel that I am able to take my abilities into the community and provide a service thanks in large part to the education that I have received at Virginia Tech. I also plan on using this Writing and Digital Media course to at some point leave an impact on the online teaching profession in the future. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Plans and Goals</h3>
                    
                    <p>My goal for the future is to get an MFA in creative writing after I finish up at Virginia Tech next spring. I have a dream of becoming a writer in the future and I would like to receive further education in order to better hone my writing in order to pursue my dream. I am unsure where I plan on going to receive my MFA but have recently started applying to several different schools. I also would like to teach at the community college level after receiving my MFA, and hopefully develop an online creative writing course that is flexible, stimulating, and helpful. I would also like to become more involved with Habitat for Humanity in the future and would like to volunteer for the organization with more frequency in the future. So, I would like to use my English degree at Virginia Tech to receive an MFA, pursue a career in writing, develop a more stimulating online creative writing course, and volunteer with more frequency for Habitat for Humanity. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Recomendations</h3>
                    
                    <p>My number one recommendation for all incoming Virginia Tech students is simple, get involved. Don’t be afraid to join several organizations during your Freshmen year and then turn your focus to one or two of them. Partnering with campus or community organizations is the best way to develop lasting friendships, serve the community, become a more well-rounded student, and enrich your educational experience. Also, don’t take your professors for granted. They are here to help you, and you should always try and visit them during their office hours. Not only will is prepare you for greater success in college, but it will also stimulate your education and make class much more interesting, applicable, and enjoying. One last piece of advice. Be yourself. At all times stay true to who you are and, I promise you, things will turn out alright in the end. </p>
