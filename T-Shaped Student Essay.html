                    <h1>The T-Shaped Student Essay</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Claim</h2>
                    
                    <p>As we venture further into the 21st century it is becoming more and more important to develop a versatile skill set and be flexible. A large number of Americans hold down multiple jobs at a time and the days of working at the same company for thirty or forty years has become less likely. Rather it be consulting part-time for a digital media firm, freelance writing for various online publications, or driving for Uber, the future seems to be pointing towards job flexibility. That is why the concept of the VT-shaped student is more important now than ever. This podcast that I put together reflects half of the equation, looking at the core foundational aspects of the T-shaped component of the VT-Shaped Student.  This podcast manages to accurately highlight the major T-shaped characteristics of the VT-shaped student by examining the vertical components as well as the horizontal components that combine to make up the T-shaped student, while also looking at how the characteristics of the T-shaped student can be used to create technological innovations in the 21st century. </p>
                    
                    <h2>The Vertical Component</h2>
                    
                    <p>The podcast first provides an in depth look at the major vertical components of the T-shaped student which play a crucial role in the greater whole of the VT-shaped student. The two major vertical components of the T-Shaped student stress the mastery of a particular discipline as well as the mastery of a particular system. Both of these elements combine to make up one of the critical elements of the VT-shaped student, the study of one’s major academic field of interest. Quite possibly the most important element of the VT-shaped student is the idea that they specialize in one particular area of study, while in turn developing a strong understanding of one particular system, such as the educational or healthcare system. This is exactly the point that I discuss in my podcast when examining the vertical element of the T-shaped student. To be a successful T-shaped student it is necessary to have a large degree of knowledge over a single particular field of interest. In this particular podcast, I demonstrate my core knowledge over the field of creative writing by highlighting the intricacies of the publishing field as well as the English language. This core knowledge will prepare you for a career and that is exactly what I stress when discussing the vertical component of the T-shaped student in my podcast.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Horizontal Component</h2>
                    
                    <p>The podcast then delves into the major components of the horizontal aspects of the T-shaped student which play an important role in the greater concept of the VT-shaped student. The horizontal components of the T-shaped student stress the development of general knowledge across a variety of disciplines and systems, placing great emphasis on the ability to move easily between a wide range of different disciplines and systems. This part of the podcast reflects the importance of being well-rounded as a T-shaped student, stressing the need to be able to communicate across disciplines and have the general knowledge necessary to be flexible in a changing job market. In particular, I highlight the importance of having a wide breadth of knowlede as a writer in order to understand individuals from a wide range of different backgrounds. To be successful in the world you need to have a general degree of knowledge in a wide range of areas of study, and that is the point that I make in this area of my podcast that is of the utmost importance to the VT-shaped student concept.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The T-Shaped Student in Action</h2>
                    
                    <p>During the latter third of the podcast I look at ways in which the major aspects of the T-shaped student are necessary in the 21st century. This part of the podcast demonstrates the practicality of being a VT-shaped student in the modern global world by looking at how a writer could use his or her core knowledge of the English language combined with his creativity and general knowledge of a wide range of disciplines to create a literature book review snap chat channel to advertise to a wider audience. Thus, this portion of the podcast reflects the T part of the VT-shaped student by showing how one’s flexibility and wide range of knowledge can be used to further his career in his core discipline of study. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    
                    <p>My podcast does a great job of highlighting the importance of mastering a core area of study, developing a flexibility and general knowledge of other disciplines, and shows how the aspects of the T-shaped student could be used in the 21st century. All of these portions of the T-shaped student are touched on in my podcast and combine to show the importance of developing both a broad but precisely focused knowledge as a larger VT-shaped student.</p>
