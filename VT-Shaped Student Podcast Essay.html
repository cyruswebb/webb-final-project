                    <h1>The VT-Shaped Student Essay</h1>
                    
                    <h2>Intro: Importance of the VT-Shaped Student</h2>
                    
                    <p>The VT-shaped student. It is a concept that has a very specific purpose and successfully builds off of the basis of the T-shaped student. As we discussed earlier, the T-shaped student is a tremendous concept because it stresses both mastery in a particular discipline and system while also placing great emphasis on general knowledge in a wide range of academic and real world fields. However, the VT-shaped student, is an even more successful concept as it builds off of the T-shaped student in two very important and distinct ways. The V aspect of the VT-shaped student stresses community engagement through Ut Prosim and experiential real world global learning. I believe that the VT-shaped student is an extremely important educational concept because it encourages creative development through interaction which is of the utmost importance in the interconnected and fast paced world we live in today. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Claim</h2>
                    
                    <p>For my final project I decided to make a second podcast that is divided up into two main parts. The first part looks at the VT-shaped student, how it is different from the T-shaped student, and why a successful writer needs to adapt to the concept of the VT-shaped student in order to be successful. The second part, I delve into my website/application prototype Writers Out of Residence, which I believe affirms the VT-shaped student ideas of community engagement, global interaction, and experiential learning by allowing writers to swap residencies for a time period of three to six months. All in all, I believe that my podcast affirms the values of the VT-shaped student by highlighting the importance of being a VT-shaped writer, as well as outlining a very VT-shaped and innovative idea. </p>
                    
                    <h2>The VT-Shaped Writer</h2>
                    
                    <p>The first half of my podcast looks at what separates your average writer from the elevated and more creative VT-shaped writer. Specifically, I looked at the genre of southern gothic literature, and how the only way to understand what lies at the core of the genre is to experience it first hand by living in and interacting with the southern United States. I backed this up by using an example of Wiley Cash’s outstanding first novel, “A Land More Kind Than Home,” which manages to be the tremendous work it is because Cash is from rural Appalachia. This element of the podcast reflects the VT-shaped student because it shows the importance of community interaction, community service, and real world experiential learning. Without experiencing and interacting with a community you fail to fully understand the world around you. That is the point that I was trying to make in the first half of the podcast. That in order to be a successful writer you have to have a degree of understanding of what you are writing about, which can only be fully achieved through personal experiences or community service/interaction. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Writers Out of Residence</h2>
                    
                    <p>The back half of my podcast looks specifically at my prototype website/program design Writers Out of Residence which facilitates VT-shaped learning by encouraging global connectivity, experiential learning, and community engagement. The program encourages global connectivity, one of the major components of the VT-shaped student by focusing on placing writers in other countries or regions of the world in which they could interact with different cultures, communities, and individuals to further their writing creativity. The program also stresses the VT shaped student idea of experiential learning by allowing for writers to learn outside of the classroom through real life interactive experiences with strangers. What better way to further your development as a writer than to gain valuable experiences with unique individuals? Lastly, the program also encourages community engagement, by placing authors in communities in which they can attempt to provide aid, knowledge, and most importantly understanding. All in all, I feel that the program I have designed reflects the VT-shaped student because it is based around several of the core principles that, when combined, make up what we think of today as the VT-shaped student. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Dimensions of Criticality</h2>
                    
                    <p>I feel like the strength of my podcast is the fact that it is relatable and leaves an impact on a variety of career paths. For instance, any type of podcast is very relevant to communication majors as, in many ways, podcasts are one of the premier waves of communication in the 21st century. My podcast is also very prevalent to global studies majors, as it encourages greater global connectivity and understanding between a variety of people from a variety of backgrounds. Lastly, I also feel that my podcast leaves a large impact on education majors, as it is encouraging experiential first hand learning, something that I feel is lacking in classrooms and schools today. </p>
                    
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    
                    <p>All in all, I feel that this podcast is crucial because it both reaffirms and provides an example of the VT-shaped student. As I’ve said throughout my website, the key to the future is connectivity! I really can’t stress that idea enough. So, as you move through school, just remember to stay open to alternative educational pathways, such as studying abroad, and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. </p>
